## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js installed on your system.
- Metamask browser extension installed and configured.
- Basic knowledge of deploying smart contracts using Remix.

---

### 1. Deploy the Smart Contract
1. Open the `Contract.sol` file from the project folder.
2. Go to [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/).
3. Create a new file in Remix and paste the contents of `Contract.sol`.
4. Compile the smart contract.
5. Deploy the contract using Remix on your desired Ethereum network (e.g., local Ganache or testnet).
6. Copy the deployed contract's address.

---

### 2. Update Contract Address
1. Navigate to the project folder.
2. Open the `web/src/contractAddress.js` file.
3. Replace the placeholder address with the address of your deployed contract:
   ```javascript
   const contractAddress = "<Your_Contract_Address>";
   export default contractAddress;
   ```

---

### 3. Run the Backend Server
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the root folder of the project.
2. Run the following commands:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

---

### 4. Set Up the Frontend Application
1. Navigate to the `web` folder:
   ```bash
   cd web
   npm install
   ```
2. Navigate to the `app` folder:
   ```bash
   cd app
   npm install
   ```

---

### 5. Run the Application
1. Run the following commands in three separate terminals:
   - For the backend:
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```
   - For the `web` folder:
     ```bash
     cd web
     npm start
     ```
   - For the `app` folder:
     ```bash
     cd app
     npm start
     ```

---

### 6. Access the Application
1. Open your browser and navigate to the local server URLs provided in the terminal.
2. Interact with the platform using your Metamask wallet to authenticate transactions.
